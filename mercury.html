    <h1 id="Introduction"> Introduction</h1>
    <p>The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter.</p>

    <h1 id="PotentialforLife"> Potential for Life</h1>
    <p>Mercury's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures and solar radiation that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme for organisms to adapt to.</p>

    <h1 id="SizeandDistance">Size and Distance </h1>
    <P>With a radius of 1,516 miles (2,440 kilometers), Mercury is a little more than 1/3 the width of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mercury would be about as big as a blueberry.
From an average distance of 36 million miles (58 million kilometers), Mercury is 0.4 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 3.2 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mercury.</P>

</section>
<br>
<ol>
  <li> Small world</li>
     <dd>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system – only slightly larger than Earth's Moon.</dd>
  <li> Inside track</li>
     <dd>Mercury is the planet that orbits the closest to the Sun.</dd>
  <li> Fastest planet</li>
     <dd>Mercury is the fastest planet in our solar system – traveling through space at nearly 29 miles (47 kilometers) per second. The closer a planet is to the Sun,
	 the faster it travels. Since Mercury is the fastest planet and has the shortest distance to travel around the Sun, it has the shortest year of all the planets in our solar system – 88 days. </dd>
  <li> Rough surface</li>
     <dd>Mercury is a rocky planet, also known as a terrestrial planet. Mercury has a solid, cratered surface, much like the Earth's moon.</dd>
  <li> Can't breathe there</li>
     <dd>Mercury's thin atmosphere, or exosphere, is composed mostly of oxygen (O2), sodium (Na), hydrogen (H2), helium (He), and potassium (K).</dd>
  <li> Moonless</li>
     <dd>Mercury has no moons. </dd>
  <li> Ringless</li>
     <dd>There are no rings around Mercury.</dd>
  <li> Tough place for life</li>
     <dd>It is unlikely that life as we know it could survive on Mercury due to solar radiation, and extreme temperatures.</dd>
  <li> Big sun</li>
     <dd>Standing on Mercury's surface at its closest approach to the Sun, our star would appear more than three times larger than it does on Earth.</dd>
  <li> Robotic visitors</li>
     <dd>Two NASA missions have explored Mercury: Mariner 10 was the first to fly by Mercury, and MESSENGER was the first to orbit. ESA's BepiColombo is on its way to Mercury.</dd>

  Mercury is the second densest planet, after Earth. It has a large metallic core with a radius of about 1,289 miles (2,074 kilometers), about 85 percent of the planet's radius. There is evidence that it is partly molten or liquid. Mercury's outer shell, comparable to Earth's outer shell (called the mantle and crust), is only about 400 kilometers (250 miles) thick
